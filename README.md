This app forecasts Gitpod usage availability for the next thirty days.

The format includes both time and credits available.

Update the `gitpodMinutes` array stored in the `array.js` file with your total Gitpod usage in minutes for each day, for the past thirty days.

- On days you do not use Gitpod enter `0`.
- At the start of each month, empty the array.
